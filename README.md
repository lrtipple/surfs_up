# Challenge 9 SurfsUp

## Purpose
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)
Files

## Resources
hawaii.sqlite , SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Numpy

### Three Differences between June and December 
- The average temperature recorded for June is 74.9 and for Decemeber the average is 71.0.
- The minimum temperature is 64.0 for, and 56.0 for December.
- The maximum temperature for 85.0 for June and 83 for December.

## Summary

The difference in average temperatures between June and December is only 3.9 degrees. The quartiles for June, range from 69-74 degrees, with the minimum recorded temperature being 64 degrees and the maximum recorded temperature being 85 degrees. The quartiles for December range from 56-74 degrees, with the minimum recorded temperature being 56 and the maximum recorded temperature being 83.

### Two Suggested Queries

Additional queries I would recommend are;
- Average temperature by month
- Average percipitation by month

These queries would show how much rain is received each month of the year, and would show what the average temperature by month is. These would help W. Avy understand if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable all year round.
